# Beats
Beats is a website where users can purchase royalty free beats and use them for their background music across different media.

# Rationale 
The "Beats" website is designed to create a vibrant and interactive community platform for music enthusiasts. It provides a space for users to buy music 

## Key Features and Their Rationales

### User Authentication and Access Control

**Rationale:** 
Restricting certain actions, such as posting reviews, to authenticated users helps maintain a high quality of content and encourages genuine contributions. By requiring users to sign up and log in, the site ensures accountability and enhances security. This restriction helps prevent spam and misuse, providing a trustworthy environment for sharing reviews.

### Blog and Gig Review System

**Rationale:**
The core feature of the site is the ability for users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their own blog posts about gigs. This system allows users to share their personal experiences, opinions, and ratings of the gigs they have attended. It fosters a community of music lovers who can connect over shared interests, creating a rich repository of reviews and discussions.

### Personalized Blog Post Management

**Rationale:**
Allowing users to edit and delete their own posts provides control over content and ensures that users can correct or remove information as needed. Admins have broader control to manage content, maintaining the site's cleanliness and appropriateness. This functionality supports user autonomy while also ensuring the integrity and quality of the content presented on the platform.

### Comment System

**Rationale:**
Enabling users to comment on blog posts enhances the platform's interactivity. It allows users to provide feedback, share additional thoughts, and engage in discussions, which contributes to a more engaging and dynamic community. This interaction helps build a sense of community and encourages active participation among users.

### Security Measures

**Rationale:**
Implementing CSRF protection and secure handling of user input (such as comments) is crucial for protecting the site from common web vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of user data. These security measures help prevent attacks and unauthorized access, safeguarding both user information and the overall stability of the site.

### Dynamic Content Display

**Rationale:**
Displaying user-generated content such as blog posts and comments dynamically ensures that the most recent and relevant information is visible to users. This feature keeps the content fresh and engaging, encouraging users to return and interact with new posts and comments.

### Administrative Functionality

**Rationale:**
Providing admin functionality for managing users, posts, and comments ensures oversight and control over the content and user interactions. This feature is important for maintaining the site's quality and integrity, allowing admins to address issues and enforce community standards effectively.


# User Stories
The purpose of Gig reviews is to let users display their thoughts on the musicians they have seen recently and to see any other reviews about gigs they maybe interesed in from other users

### User Goals
* To buy royalty free music
* To have a platform to purchase music for a fixed price with no royalty confusion
* To purchase music, using online payments
* To have the option to listen to the music before they purchase
* 

### Site Owner goals 

* To make a website where the site owner can upload own music for free and sell to the public
* Make a fully functioning online shop, where users can preview and purchase instrumentals
* Ensure that only logged-in users can post reviews and comments.
* Make a database where when users have stored their information it can be seen from the admin panel for the admin 
* To give the option for users to remove themselves off the database
* To see the amount of orders and order details on the admin panel 
* To keep track of payments using stripe 


# UX Design

For the colour scheme I have gone with a fun pastel colour with all of the colours complimenting eachother and a simple design so users know what they're looking at as soon as they load the page.

# Data Schema Overview

The **Gig Reviews** website uses Flask and SQLAlchemy for database management. The data schema defines the structure of our database tables and their relationships. Below is a detailed description of each table and its relationships.

## Schema Breakdown

### User Table (`User` Class)

- **Table Name:** `users`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).
  - `email`: User’s email address (must be unique).
  - `password`: User’s password.
  - `first_name`: User’s first name.
  - `is_admin`: Boolean flag to indicate if the user is an admin.
- **Relationships:**
  - `notes`: One-to-many relationship with the `Note` table (a user can have multiple notes).
  - `comments`: One-to-many relationship with the `Comment` table (a user can have multiple comments).
  - `blog_posts`: One-to-many relationship with the `BlogPost` table (a user can have multiple blog posts).

### Note Table (`Note` Class)

- **Table Name:** `notes`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each note (Primary Key).
  - `data`: Content of the note.
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key linking to the `users` table.
  - `is_public`: Boolean flag to indicate if the note is public.

### BlogPost Table (`BlogPost` Class)

- **Table Name:** `blog_posts`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each blog post (Primary Key).
  - `title`: Title of the blog post.
  - `content`: Content of the blog post.
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key linking to the `users` table.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the blog post was created.
- **Relationships:**
  - `comments`: One-to-many relationship with the `Comment` table (a blog post can have multiple comments).

### Comment Table (`Comment` Class)

- **Table Name:** `comments`
- **Columns:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each comment (Primary Key).
  - `content`: Content of the comment.
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key linking to the `users` table.
  - `blog_post_id`: Foreign Key linking to the `blog_posts` table.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the comment was created.

## Summary

- **Tables:** `users`, `notes`, `blog_posts`, `comments`
- **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers for each table (`id` columns).
- **Foreign Keys:** Links between tables (e.g., `user_id` in `notes` and `comments`, `blog_post_id` in `comments`).
- **Relationships:**
  - **One-to-Many:** One `User` can have multiple `notes`, `comments`, and `blog_posts`.
  - **One-to-Many:** One `BlogPost` can have multiple `comments`.

This schema ensures that data is organized efficiently and relationships between different entities are properly maintained. It provides a clear structure for how data is stored and linked within the application.


 # WireFrames Desktop

 For the wireframes I didn't have a wireframe designer so I designed the app on Adobe Photoshop.
1. Wireframe for profile

2. Blog form to submit a blog

## Future features
 For the future features I would like to add a shop page to the website where the user can click on the image and buy the image from the website and for it to be printed onto a canvas.

## W3C Validation 
Managed to fix these few errors by finding the lines of code referenced on the page and removing the stray tags and correctly formating the code. Here are the results.

I had made a previous account called "Twinwinter" on my email address robertwinterburn@hotmail.co.uk and I had made a new account to make my name a bit more professional and readable (RWinterburn) but when I started making commits they came from "Twinwinter" on one and "RWinterburn" from another I don't know wether it was to do with me from switching from gitpod.io and codeanywhere to VScode need to figure this problem out for future developments as I haven't figured it out yet. So you will see commits from both of my Github accounts, dont think this has happened again. Resolved by git.

I did run into a problem I had to sign up for gitpod.io with my student account after I already had started my website so there will be a commit name saying "RWinterburn2" it is linked to my student email.

I tried signing up for Heroku so I had to find alternatives and it slowed my project to a halt for a few days finding a solution asked for an extended deadline on the project but I only managed to get a request form in at the last minute(Managed to fix heroku by starting new account unfortunately im getting charged at the minute though for add ons)
